# Machine Learning

My personal collection of all of the links I've found helpful in learning about ML.

## General

* [Christopher Olah's blog](http://colah.github.io/) - some of the best explanations for common + intermediate ML concepts that I've seen so far.

## Neural Networks

### Convolutional Neural Networks

* An in-depth visual and mathematical [overview of CNNs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.07285v1.pdf) *(30 mins)*
* A brief explanation of [max pooling](https://www.quora.com/What-is-max-pooling-in-convolutional-neural-networks) *(1 min)*

## Generative Models

### Audio

* [**WaveNet** by Google DeepMind (2016)](https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/) ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03499.pdf))
